## Mod explorations
- double check if fzzy config/kotlin is actually mucking up config saving
  - seems to only be a problem when changing mods?
- double check the vanillatweaks setup and update the sharecode
- stroll through Modrinth resource packs -- maybe replace vanillatweaks?
- get InControl or similar to make dinosaur spawns limited

## Problems

- [x] betternether/betterend have broken recipes
  - this also affects the Cold Sweat sewing table
  - thallasium and cincinnasite are tagged wrong, add them to Almost Unified's ignore list
- [ ] Can't shift-click fuel into furnace properly
- [ ] Inventory sort button overlaps Tetra UI
- [ ] Cold breath happens even in the nether

## Things to make quests/guides for

- Tetra

## Mod Indexing

Create a markdown document indexing all mods by category, with any notes required

Take note of progression mods and how they're started. If they don't give a book, make note so you can go back and make a questbook later.

## Config

- basically everything
- cold sweat configs
- check configs from t24
